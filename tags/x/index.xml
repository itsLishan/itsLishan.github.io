      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bernie + Bernice is a 1- or 2-person interactive experience that is intended for lobbies and other passive public spaces. During gameplay, players move their bodies to control a particle system displayed on a large screen in front of them. Particles leave a trace of their recent movement, allowing players to create ephemeral particle art as they move. One player alone can control the system to satisfaction, but a second player introduces a new strong force that allows them to manipulate the system together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience is “always on.” A spherical particle system sits in the middle of the screen, pulsing such that it almost seems to breathe, waiting to be played with. An unknowing passerby causes the particles to move with them, and begins to play without even realizing. If the passerby chooses to try out different body movements (such as opening their hands wide), they will discover new ways to play. My intention was to make the experience as approachable as possible, such that someone might discover play through their everyday movements, and if they choose, engage further through exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project was to get people to move their bodies in public space, to disrupt both their daily routine and the formality of behavior in public space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece was on display at the iMappening Showcase in 2014, and has been on display at various points in time in the lobby of the School of Cinematic Arts at USC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Commute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Commute is a power fantasy game about street harassment. Built around true-to-life experiences of catcalling, the game highlights the destructive nature of street harassment while inviting players to choose how to “deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You play as Amber, who just wants to wear her clothes of choice and get to the metro with her emotional health intact. Help her dodge catcallers and their harmful words, and fight back when things get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All catcalls in this game are based on true stories, obtained by polling women in our network about their everyday experiences with street harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://itslishan.com/daycare-quest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shonnie&amp;rsquo;s Daycare Quest&lt;/a&gt; is an interactive animated film about a mother trying to obtain subsidized childcare for her daughter in Washington, DC. The player makes decisions for Shonnie as she jumps through bureaucratic hoops, trying to succeed before Shonnie gets fired for missing too many days of work. This story is based on the testimony of real women in Washington, DC, archived through the advocacy work of Empower DC and Grassroots DC. The illustrations were drawn by the children of the mothers who offered their testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play it &lt;a href=&#34;http://itslishan.com/daycare-quest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bathroom Experiment</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Bathroom Experiment was an interactive intervention performed in USC&amp;rsquo;s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA). We performed the experiment in 14 men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s bathrooms (12 in SCA, 2 in a dining hall) by writing a question in dry-erase marker on the  bathroom mirror, and leaving a marker tethered to the sink for future bathroom visitors to use. We deliberately chose the private space of bathrooms to stage this public conversation. This had particular significance in the pristine buildings of SCA, where any modification to the space is highly discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gender-question-in-a-gendered-space&#34;&gt;Gender Question in a Gendered Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this experiment, we sought to spark conversation about gender in the only gender-segregated space we occupy daily: public restrooms. We asked unsuspecting participants, &amp;ldquo;Why did you choose the women&amp;rsquo;s/men&amp;rsquo;s bathroom today?&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;a decision many folks make daily without thinking, while for others it can be a source of trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;splitImage&#34; src=&#34;http://itslishan.com/images/BathExper_Setup.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this was a guerilla project, we anticipated getting shut down at any moment. In the short time that the experiment stayed up (as short as 30 minutes in some bathrooms), we generated a high level of engagement. More photos of results coming soon :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: dry-erase marker wipes cleanly from mirrors, and we were prepared to clean up the mess ourselves so as to not put more work on any cleaning staff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beauty of H Street</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beauty of H Street&amp;rdquo; examines the history of H Street Northeast, once a hub of African American barber shops and salons. The documentary follows the neighborhood from the ‘60s riots to destitution to its current state as one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Washington, DC. It features interviews from barbershop owners who were there from the &amp;lsquo;60s until now, and spoken word from DC youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won a grant from The Humanities Council to complete this project.&lt;/p&gt;
