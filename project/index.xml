      <description>On July 27, 1919, at a segregated beach on the south side of Chicago, 17-year-old Eugene Williams was stoned to death after floating across the imaginary color line in Lake Michigan. Building on the legend of an underwater paradise prevalent in African folklore, Eugene’s Cove imagines an underwater world where those we thought drowned actually sank and became something more. Drawing on mythology and historical events from across the Black diaspora, this exhibit celebrates the ways we reclaim water as a source of freedom.</description>

      <description>Tracking Ida is an educational alternate reality game (ARG) inspired by the pioneering investigative journalism of Ida B. Wells in the 1890s. Players uncover Ida B. Wells’ crusade against lynching and use her strategies to investigate police and vigilante killings today. Along the way, they solve puzzles, decode messages through a phonograph, role-play as investigative journalists, and interview members of their community.
