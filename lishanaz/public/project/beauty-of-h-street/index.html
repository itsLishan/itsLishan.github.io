    <p>&ldquo;Beauty of H Street&rdquo; examines the history of H Street Northeast, once a hub of African American barber shops and salons. The documentary follows the neighborhood from the â€˜60s riots to destitution to its current state as one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Washington, DC. It features interviews from barbershop owners who were there from the &lsquo;60s until now, and spoken word from DC youth.</p>

<p>We won a grant from The Humanities Council to complete this project.</p>
