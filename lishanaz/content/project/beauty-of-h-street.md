"Beauty of H Street" examines the history of H Street Northeast, once a hub of African American barber shops and salons. The documentary follows the neighborhood from the â€˜60s riots to destitution to its current state as one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Washington, DC. It features interviews from barbershop owners who were there from the '60s until now, and spoken word from DC youth. 

We won a grant from The Humanities Council to complete this project.
