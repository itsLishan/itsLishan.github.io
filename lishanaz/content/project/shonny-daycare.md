Shonny's Daycare Quest is a sarcastic interactive film about a mother jumping through hoops to obtain subsidized childcare for her daughter in Washington, DC. Shonny, the protagonist, has to take days off of work to endure the lengthy process of obtaining a government subsidy, and finding a daycare that that will accept it. The player makes decisions for Shonny as she jumps through bureaucratic hoops, trying to succeed before Shonny gets fired for missing too many days of work. 

At every step of production, I tied the design process to the people whose stories I was depicting. The piece uses real statistics and testimonies from parents, obtained through the advocacy work of Empower DC and Grassroots DC. The characters (for the stop-motion animation) were drawn by the children of the parents who offered their testimony.
