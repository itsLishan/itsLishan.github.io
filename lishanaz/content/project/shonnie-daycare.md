<a href="/daycare-quest" target="_blank">Shonnie's Daycare Quest</a> is an interactive animated film about a mother trying to obtain subsidized childcare for her daughter in Washington, DC. The player makes decisions for Shonnie as she jumps through bureaucratic hoops, trying to succeed before Shonnie gets fired for missing too many days of work. This story is based on the testimony of real women in Washington, DC, archived through the advocacy work of Empower DC and Grassroots DC. The illustrations were drawn by the children of the mothers who offered their testimony.
