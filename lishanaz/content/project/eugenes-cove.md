On July 27, 1919, at a segregated beach on the south side of Chicago, 17-year-old Eugene Williams was stoned to death after floating across the imaginary color line in Lake Michigan. Building on the legend of an underwater paradise prevalent in African folklore, Eugene’s Cove imagines an underwater world where those we thought drowned actually sank and became something more. Drawing on mythology and historical events from across the Black diaspora, this exhibit celebrates the ways we reclaim water as a source of freedom.
