    <p>Light Snatcher is a fast-paced collaborative game played on a strip of LED lights with mobile controllers. Each player (up to 6) is assigned a color and controls a small section of the strip. When the light moves through your section, tap your phone to &ldquo;snatch&rdquo; it. Each time the light is captured, it speeds up, making it harder to catch.</p>

<p>Light Snatcher is played on a flexible, water-proof strip of lights. Wear the strip on your body and let your friends play around you&ndash;try twirling in place to up the ante. Sit at a bar and play with strangers without worrying about your drink spilling.</p>

<p>Light Snatcher was a one-week experiment in spring 2016, which we recently picked up again. More progress (and better documentation) to come!</p>
