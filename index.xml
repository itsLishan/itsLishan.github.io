      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://playthelocker.com/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Locker&lt;/a&gt; is a mixed-reality installation game in which you explore physical artifacts with your hands and reveal memories using a bewitched magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You receive a note from Jade, a student at your high school who has recently gone missing, and decide to do some snooping. Inside her locker, you find diary entries to read, physical puzzles to solve, artifacts to investigate, and memories to reveal with your magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining physical exploration with puzzle and film, the Locker will engage quite a few of your senses for a memorable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was featured in an LA times &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-usc-women-video-game-design-program-20160124-htmlstory.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bernie + Bernice is a 1- or 2-person interactive experience that is intended for lobbies and other passive public spaces. During gameplay, players move their bodies to control a particle system displayed on a large screen in front of them. Particles leave a trace of their recent movement, allowing players to create ephemeral particle art as they move. One player alone can control the system to satisfaction, but a second player introduces a new strong force that allows them to manipulate the system together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience is “always on.” A spherical particle system sits in the middle of the screen, pulsing such that it almost seems to breathe, waiting to be played with. An unknowing passerby causes the particles to move with them, and begins to play without even realizing. If the passerby chooses to try out different body movements (such as opening their hands wide), they will discover new ways to play. My intention was to make the experience as approachable as possible, such that someone might discover play through their everyday movements, and if they choose, engage further through exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project was to get people to move their bodies in public space, to disrupt both their daily routine and the formality of behavior in public space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piece was on display at the iMappening Showcase in 2014, and has been on display at various points in time in the lobby of the School of Cinematic Arts at USC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shonnie&#39;s Daycare Quest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://itslishan.com/daycare-quest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shonnie&amp;rsquo;s Daycare Quest&lt;/a&gt; is an interactive animated film about a mother trying to obtain subsidized childcare for her daughter in Washington, DC. The player makes decisions for Shonnie as she jumps through bureaucratic hoops, trying to succeed before Shonnie gets fired for missing too many days of work. This story is based on the testimony of real women in Washington, DC, archived through the advocacy work of Empower DC and Grassroots DC. The illustrations were drawn by the children of the mothers who offered their testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play it &lt;a href=&#34;http://itslishan.com/daycare-quest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Her Parlour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Her Parlour is a new style of museum audio tour that challenges visitors to find art pieces as they progress through a story. Designed for the Home Décor exhibit of The Getty, Her Parlour transforms the exhibit into the estate of Adrienne, a middle-aged wife in 18th century France who is trying to fix her failing marriage. Convinced she can rekindle the love of her husband by reminding him of their newlywed days, she searches for the artifacts that will bring back his first memories of her. Players find the items she seeks, enter answers into the mobile app, and get deeper into the story of their marriage and French noble society of that time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Parlour was developed during a 27 hour game jam hosted by The Getty Center in 2016. Our challenge was to create an experience that helps players discover something interesting about the art they might have missed in a quick look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Parlour won 3rd place in the competition, judged by a panel of Jenova Chen, founder of ThatGameCompany; Stephanie Barish, CEO of IndieCade; Richard Lemarchand, USC IMGD associate chair; and Jack Ludden, head of web and new media development at the Getty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See The Getty&amp;rsquo;s blog post about the jam &lt;a href = &#34;http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/a-night-at-the-museum-the-2016-gettyusc-game-jam/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beauty of H Street&amp;rdquo; examines the history of H Street Northeast, once a hub of African American barber shops and salons. The documentary follows the neighborhood from the ‘60s riots to destitution to its current state as one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Washington, DC. It features interviews from barbershop owners who were there from the &amp;lsquo;60s until now, and spoken word from DC youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won a grant from The Humanities Council to complete this project.&lt;/p&gt;
