      <description>The Locker is a mixed-reality installation game in which you explore physical artifacts with your hands and reveal memories using a bewitched magnifying glass.
You receive a note from Jade, a student at your high school who has recently gone missing, and decide to do some snooping. Inside her locker, you find diary entries to read, physical puzzles to solve, artifacts to investigate, and memories to reveal with your magnifying glass.</description>

      <description>Bernie + Bernice is a 1- or 2-person interactive experience that is intended for lobbies and other passive public spaces. During gameplay, players move their bodies to control a particle system displayed on a large screen in front of them. Particles leave a trace of their recent movement, allowing players to create ephemeral particle art as they move. One player alone can control the system to satisfaction, but a second player introduces a new strong force that allows them to manipulate the system together.</description>

      <description>The Bathroom Experiment was an interactive intervention performed in USC&amp;rsquo;s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA). We performed the experiment in 14 men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s bathrooms (12 in SCA, 2 in a dining hall) by writing a question in dry-erase marker on the bathroom mirror, and leaving a marker tethered to the sink for future bathroom visitors to use. We deliberately chose the private space of bathrooms to stage this public conversation.</description>

      <guid>https://lishanaz.com/light-snatcher/</guid>
      <description>Light Snatcher is a fast-paced collaborative game played on a strip of LED lights with mobile controllers. Each player (up to 6) is assigned a color and controls a small section of the strip. When the light moves through your section, tap your phone to &amp;ldquo;snatch&amp;rdquo; it. Each time the light is captured, it speeds up, making it harder to catch.
Light Snatcher is played on a flexible, water-proof strip of lights.</description>

      <description>The Commute is a power fantasy game about street harassment. Built around true-to-life experiences of catcalling, the game highlights the destructive nature of street harassment while inviting players to choose how to “deal with it.”
You play as Amber, who just wants to wear her clothes of choice and get to the metro with her emotional health intact. Help her dodge catcallers and their harmful words, and fight back when things get out of hand.</description>

      <description>Her Parlour is a new style of museum audio tour that challenges visitors to find art pieces as they progress through a story. Designed for the Home Décor exhibit of The Getty, Her Parlour transforms the exhibit into the estate of Adrienne, a middle-aged wife in 18th century France who is trying to fix her failing marriage. Convinced she can rekindle the love of her husband by reminding him of their newlywed days, she searches for the artifacts that will bring back his first memories of her.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Beauty of H Street&amp;rdquo; examines the history of H Street Northeast, once a hub of African American barber shops and salons. The documentary follows the neighborhood from the ‘60s riots to destitution to its current state as one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in Washington, DC. It features interviews from barbershop owners who were there from the &amp;rsquo;60s until now, and spoken word from DC youth.
We won a grant from The Humanities Council to complete this project.</description>
